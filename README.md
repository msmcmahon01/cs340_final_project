This application stores information for a fictional chain of rock climbing gyms. It has which gym has what route setters
(workers that construct the routes), what routes a gym has, which routes have what holds, what setters have worked on which
routes, and details about each of those entities. Employees would use this database to manage their gyms and routes, because
they can update what holds are in use, update where a setter is working, and delete routes when they get taken down.

Functionality & Requirements:
- A list of all gyms can be displayed.
- A list of all routes at a gym can be displayed, including its setter and total hold count.
- A list of the counts of routes of each difficulty can be displayed for a gym.
- A list of all setters employed at a gym can be displayed, including the total gyms they are employed at.
- A list of all routes set by a setter can be displayed, including its gym and total hold count.
- A list of all routes set by a setter at a specific gym can be displayed, including its total hold count.
- A list of statistics for each gym can be displayed, only showing a gym’s id, number of routes, and average difficulty of its routes.
- The user can add a new gym.
- The user can change a setter’s name.
- The user can delete a gym.
- The user can delete all routes at a gym that were created on a specific date.
